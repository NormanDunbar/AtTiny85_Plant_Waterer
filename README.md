# AtTiny85_Plant_Waterer
This system, for want of a better word, uses an AtTiny running at 1MHz, to sleep in power off mode (pulling only about 6 microAmps) until a certain time has gone by. It then checks a digital moisture sensor and if high, turns on a relay to operate a pump to water the plant.
